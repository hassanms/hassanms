### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; 

I'm an enthusiastic Full Stack Engineer üë®üèª‚Äçüíª currently consulting for [Atarim](https://atarim.io) ‚ö°. I have nothing significant on GitHub because I mostly write code that makes money. As a problem solver, I thrive on challenges and have a diverse skill set in Full Stack Development, Blockchain, and AI. I excel at translating client requirements into features and have exceptional communication skills, enabling me to quickly understand other people's perspectives without them having to repeat themselves.

With a keen eye for detail, I focus on ensuring the highest quality software possible, without losing sight of the bigger picture. My experience includes extensive work with Full Stack Web Development (Next.js, Chakra UI, GraphCMS, React, Node, Redux, Sagas, Material UI, Laravel), Blockchain (Solidity, Ethers, Hardhat, Web3, Remix, Metamask), Artificial Intelligence (Python, Django, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, OpenCV, Colab), and DevOps (EC2, RDS, S3, Route53, ECS). 

As a project manager, I lead small teams using Scrum methodologies. I motivate and appreciate my team while holding myself responsible for any criticism or pressure, enabling the team to remain focused on building quality software.

My goal is to join a fast-growing startup and leverage my skills to create value and drive the company's growth. Ideally, I am seeking a role with a silicon valley-based startup that offers decent compensation.

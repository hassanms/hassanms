### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; 

I'm an enthusiastic Full Stack Engineer 👨🏻‍💻 currently leading for [Tech Emulsion](https://techemulsion.com) ⚡.

I have nothing significant on GitHub because I mostly write code that makes money. 

As a problem solver, I thrive on challenges and have a diverse skill set in Full Stack Development, Gen-AI, and Blockchain. I excel at translating client requirements into features and have exceptional communication skills, enabling me to quickly understand other people's perspectives without them having to repeat themselves.

If you're a startup based out of Silicon Valley, feel free to reach out.
